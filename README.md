A personal repo for enhancement the skills of Python. Stars mean Difficulty of the challenges. 

* Challenge 1 :star:

    Find the first index of a sub string out of a source string

* Challenge 2 :star:

    Find the longest word of a sentence

* Challenge 3 :star:

    Check the type of array

* Challenge 4 :star:

    Check a number is a prime number or not  

* Challenge 5 :star:

    Capitalize the first letter of a sentence.

* Challenge 6 :star:

    Find out whether or not a string or object hast unique value.

* Challenge 7 :star::star:

    Check if all the numbers summed up are equal to a largest number that we have in an array

* Challenge 8 :star::star:

    Dynamic filter the unique value of an Array

* Challenge 9 :star:

    Find first word with greatest number of repeated letter

* Challenge 10 :star:

    Find the second value of an array

* Challenge 11 :star::star:

    Return number with most repeats, if two numbers the repeated the same return first if none repeated return -1

* Challenge 12 :star:

    Reverse a string by using different methods

* Challenge 13 :star:

    Factorialze a number and return the result

* Challenge 14 :star:

    Check a given string is a palindrome or not

* Challenge 15 :star:

    Find the largest number of a two-dimensions array

* Challenge 16 :star:

    Confirm the ending of a string and compares it to the target string

* Challenge 17 :star:

    Using different methods to repeat a string

* Challenge 18 :star:

    Truncate a string if it is longer than the given maximum string length.
    Return the truncated string with a `...` ending. However, if the given maximum
    string length `num` is less than or equal to 3, then the addition of the three dots
    does not add to the string length in determining the truncated string.

* Challenge 19 :star:

    Write a function that splits an array (first auguments) into groups the length  
    of `size` (second argument) and return them as a two-dimensional array.

* Challenge 20 :star:

    Return the remaining elements of an array after chopping off `n` elements from the head.

* Challenge 21 :star::star:

    Count repeating letters, string will not contain numbers or submols only letters.

* Challenge 22 :star:

    Mutations: return true if the first element of the array contains all of the letters of the string in the second element of the array.

* Challenge 23 :star:

    Remove all flasy values from an array.

* Challenge 24 :star::star:

    Be provided with an initial array (the first argument in the destroyer function), followed by one or more arguments. Remove all elements from the initial array that are of the same value as these arguments.

* Challenge 25 :star::star::star: LeetCode -> 001

    Given an array of integers, return indices of 
    the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
    the first index should smaller than second
